# Story 005: Calendar & Scheduling Management System

**Epic:** Epic 004 - Calendar & Scheduling Optimization (Phase 4)
**Status:** In Progress - Backend Completed, Frontend Components Under Active Development
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Effort:** 14 points
**Assigned to:** Development Team - Phase 4

---

## Goal & Context

**What:** Implement a comprehensive calendar and scheduling management system that provides delivery drivers and warehouse staff with intuitive scheduling tools, including calendar views with day/week/month options, delivery time slot management, and route optimization suggestions for enhanced operational efficiency.

**Why:** Calendar and scheduling functionality transforms ShipmentApp from a reactive delivery management tool into a proactive scheduling platform. This Phase 4 feature enables optimized delivery planning, reduces delivery costs by 30% through efficient route planning, improves customer satisfaction through better time slot management, and enhances overall operational visibility for dispatch coordination.

**Epic Context:** This is the foundation story in Epic 004 that introduces scheduling capabilities to the platform. Building on the delivery workflow from Phase 3, this phase adds temporal management capabilities essential for scaling delivery operations and providing professional scheduling services to customers.

**Dependencies:** Stories 001-004 must be completed (authentication, shipment management, customer search, and digital delivery workflow) as this story requires those data foundations for scheduling functionality.
