# Story 002: Basic Shipment and Order Listing

**Epic:** Epic 001 - Core Authentication & User Management  
**Status:** Complete (100% Achievement) - FINAL VALIDATION COMPLETED  
**Frontend Status:** 100% Complete - All UI components implemented with Material Design, mobile optimization, responsive design, pagination, loading states, and error handling  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 points  
**Assigned to:** Unassigned  

---

## Goal & Context

**What:** Implement basic shipment and order listing functionality that allows authenticated users to view and browse shipments and orders from Dolibarr ERP system.

**Why:** After successful authentication (Story 001), users need immediate access to their delivery and warehouse data to perform their daily operations. This provides the core data visibility that drives the entire application's value proposition.

**Epic Context:** This is the second story in Epic 001 and builds directly on the authentication foundation. It enables users to see their work data and prepares for the search functionality (Story 003).

**Dependencies:** Story 001 (User Authentication System) - Users must be authenticated before accessing shipment/order data

## Implementation Details

### Assumptions
- Dolibarr ERP contains shipment data in `llx_expedition` table
- Dolibarr ERP contains order data in `llx_commande` table
- Customer information available in `llx_societe` table
- Basic authentication is implemented (Story 001 complete)
- Users have appropriate permissions to view shipment/order data
- Mobile-first design requirements for touch interfaces

### Security Requirements
- All endpoints require authentication (reuse Sanctum from Story 001)
- Users can only view data they have permission to access
- Rate limiting on API endpoints (60 requests per minute)
- Input validation for all query parameters
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Data sanitization before caching
- No write operations against Dolibarr database

### Performance Requirements
- List API response time < 500ms
- Individual record fetch < 200ms
- Pagination support for large datasets (10, 25, 50, 100 items per page)
- Cache hit rate > 85% for frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading for detailed views
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing

### Error Handling
- 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests
- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access attempts
- 404 Not Found for missing records
- 500 Internal Server Error for system failures
- Graceful handling of Dolibarr connection failures
- Clear error messages for frontend display

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Backend)
- `tests/Unit/DolibarrDataServiceTest.php` - Service layer testing
- `tests/Feature/ShipmentTest.php` - Shipment API endpoint testing
- `tests/Feature/OrderTest.php` - Order API endpoint testing
- Test data mapping from Dolibarr to local models
- Test pagination and filtering logic
- Test caching behavior and TTL expiration
- Test error handling for connection failures

### Integration Tests (Frontend)
- `src/app/core/services/shipment.service.spec.ts` - Shipment service testing
- `src/app/core/services/order.service.spec.ts` - Order service testing
- `src/app/features/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts` - Dashboard testing

- Test responsive design behavior

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Happy Path:** User logs in and sees their assigned shipments/orders
2. **Pagination:** User navigates through multiple pages of results
3. **Filtering:** User filters shipments by status or date range
4. **Mobile View:** User accesses dashboard on mobile device
5. **Connection Failure:** System handles Dolibarr connectivity issues
6. **Empty State:** User sees appropriate message when no data available
7. **Large Dataset:** System handles 1000+ shipments/orders efficiently

### Success Criteria
- User can view list of shipments within 2 seconds of login
- User can view list of orders within 2 seconds of navigation
- Pagination works correctly for all page sizes
- Mobile interface is fully functional and touch-optimized
- Data accurately reflects Dolibarr information
- Loading states provide clear user feedback
- Error messages are helpful and actionable
- Dashboard is responsive across all target devices
