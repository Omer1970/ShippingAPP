# Story 004: Digital Delivery Workflow & Signature Management

**Epic:** Epic 003 - Digital Delivery & Signature Management (Phase 3)  
**Status:** Completed - Ready for QA  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 16 points  
**Assigned to:** Unassigned  

---

## Goal & Context

**What:** Implement a complete digital delivery confirmation system with real-time shipment status updates, mobile-optimized digital signature capture, photo documentation, GPS location tracking, and immediate ERP synchronization for paperless delivery workflow.

**Why:** This represents the core differentiating functionality that transforms ShipmentApp from a data viewing tool into a complete digital delivery solution. Digital signatures eliminate paper-based delivery notes, reduce administrative overhead by 40%, and provide immediate delivery confirmation with full audit trails.

**Epic Context:** This is the first story in Epic 003 and represents the critical Phase 3 feature set. It builds on the authentication and search capabilities from previous stories, adding the signature capture and delivery confirmation workflow that enables the paperless delivery transformation promised in the product vision.

**Dependencies:** Stories 001, 002, and 003 must be completed (authentication, shipment/order listing, and customer search) as this story requires those data foundations for delivery confirmation
