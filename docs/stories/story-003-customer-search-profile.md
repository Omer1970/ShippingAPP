# Story 003: Customer Search and Profile Management

**Epic:** Epic 002 - Search & Customer Management (Phase 2)  
**Status:** Implementation Complete - Ready for QA Review  
**Frontend Status:** Complete  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 points  
**Assigned to:** Unassigned  

---

## Goal & Context

**What:** Implement comprehensive customer search functionality with autocomplete, detailed customer profiles, and complete order/shipment history integration, along with advanced filtering capabilities for enhanced data discovery.

**Why:** Users need rapid access to customer information to provide exceptional service, understand customer history, and make informed delivery decisions. This functionality enables the core customer-centric workflow that differentiates ShipmentApp from basic delivery tools.

**Epic Context:** This is the third story in the product development and represents the first Phase 2 feature set. It builds on Stories 001 and 002, adding customer-focused search capabilities critical for the value proposition.

**Dependencies:** Stories 001 and 002 must be completed (authentication and basic shipment/order listing) as this story requires those data foundations

## Implementation Details

### Assumptions
- Dolibarr contains customer data in `llx_societe` table with comprehensive contact information
- Customer data contains names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers suitable for searching
- Search performance requires indexing for sub-2-second response times
- Mobile users need autocomplete for faster data entry on touch devices
- Customer history includes 12+ months of orders and shipments for comprehensive view
- Advanced filtering supports date ranges, status combinations, and location-based searches
- Search popularity tracking improves result relevance over time

### Security Requirements
- All search endpoints require authentication (reuse existing Sanctum)
- Users can only search customers they have permission to view
- Rate limiting on autocomplete endpoints (120 requests per minute)
- Search query validation to prevent injection attacks
- Customer data access restricted by role (drivers vs warehouse staff)
- No customer data caching in CDN or public caches
- Audit trail for customer profile access
- GDPR-compliant search logging with user consent

### Performance Requirements
- Autocomplete response time < 200ms (5x faster than 2s requirement)
- Customer search results < 500ms for all queries
- Customer profile load time < 1 second including history
- Advanced search with filtering < 2 seconds (per requirement)
- Search result caching with 85%+ hit rate for autocomplete
- Full-text search indexing for 50,000+ customer records

- Database query optimization with proper indexing strategy

### Error Handling
- 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests
- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized customer data access
- 404 Not Found for missing customers
- 422 Unprocessable Entity for invalid search queries
- 500 Internal Server Error for system failures
